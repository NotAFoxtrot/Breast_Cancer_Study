# Breast_Cancer_Study

This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from the 2017 November update of the SEER Program of the NCI, which provides information on population-based cancer statistics. The dataset involved female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer (SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3) diagnosed in 2006-2010. Patients with unknown tumour size, examined regional LNs, positive regional LNs, and patients whose survival months were less than 1 month were excluded; thus, 4024 patients were ultimately included.

Race - race of the person, other includes pacific islander and other more specific races
Marital Status - Married, Divorced, Single, Widow

Estrogen Status - whether or not the cancer has estrogen receptors
Progesterone Status - whether or not the cancer has progesterone receptors
Regional Node Examined - which specific lymph node the cells were tested from. Will probably drop. Not explained well.
Regional Node Positive - will probably drop for same reason above
